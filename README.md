# xyzSorter

DEPRECATED: Further deveolpment happens [here](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/orca-helpers/orca-helpers/)

You can use this python script if you have similar structures of the same molecule
and want to match the ordering of the atoms.

The script requires two xyz files that are as closely aligned as possible.
